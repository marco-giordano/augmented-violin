The augmented violin project utilize an ESP32S2 microcontroller to gather, elaborate and send accelerometric data acquired through an MMA8451 accelerometer placed on a violin. The following libraries are required: WiFi (for ESP32), ArduinoOSC, Adafruit MMA8451, Adafruit Unified Sensor. The firmware works by creating its own WiFi network to send via OSC the data once they are gathered and elaborated. The OSC messages are sent to Wekinator and the data it's used by the opportunely trained AI model to trigger rensponses from specific movements of the violin.

Patches in PureData can be built for applying live digital effects on the violin triggered by the responses sent to them from Wekinator. The demoeff.pd patch provides an example for that. It uses the "mrpeach" library to handle correctly the OSC messages and switch on or off some effect we build for demonstration (DelayViolin.pd, FlangerViolin.pd, PhaserViolin.pd).
